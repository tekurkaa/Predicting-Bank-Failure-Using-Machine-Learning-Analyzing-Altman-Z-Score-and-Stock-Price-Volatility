# Predicting-Bank-Failure-Using-Machine-Learning-Analyzing-Altman-Z-Score-and-Stock-Price-Volatility

This study explores the application of machine learning techniques to predict financial distress in U.S.- based banks by analyzing stock price volatility and the Altman Z-Score trends alongside macroeconomic and microeconomic indicators. Using a dataset spanning 24 years (2000â€“2024) and 26 banks, the research evaluates traditional accounting ratios against market-based metrics in a predictive framework. Employing models such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks, the study identifies the most significant predictors of bank failure and assesses their performance. Results indicate that while both approaches yield high accuracy, Altman Z-Score-based models perform slightly better than stock price-based models when combined with the computation power of machine learning. The findings highlight the synergy of integrating machine learning applications and other diverse indicators to improve predictive accuracy and support proactive risk management.
