# Predicting-Bank-Failure-Using-Machine-Learning-Analyzing-Altman-Z-Score-and-Stock-Price-Volatility

This study explores the application of machine learning techniques to predict financial distress in U.S.-based banks by analyzing stock price volatility and the Altman Z-Score trends alongside macroeconomic and microeconomic indicators. Using a dataset spanning 24 years (2000â€“2024) and 26 banks, the research evaluates traditional accounting ratios against market-based metrics in a predictive framework. Employing models such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Sequential Neural Networks, the study identifies the most significant predictors of bank failure and assesses their performance on 2 default definitions for each - stock price change-based and Altman Z-Score change-based. Results indicate that the XGBoost algorithm performs the best out of all yielding a high accuracy, with the Altman Z-Score-based model performing a lot better than the stock price-based model. The findings highlight the synergy of integrating machine learning applications and other diverse indicators to improve predictive accuracy and support proactive risk management.
